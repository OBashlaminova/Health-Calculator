      <p>
        BMR stands for Basal Metabolic Rate, which is the number of calories your body needs at rest
        to maintain basic physiological functions such as breathing, circulation, and cell
        production.
      </p>
    )
  },
  {
    key: '1',
    label: 'How is BMR calculated?',
    children: (
      <p>
        BMR can be calculated using various formulas, such as the Harris-Benedict equation. These
        formulas take into account factors like age, gender, weight, and height to estimate the
        number of calories your body needs at rest.
      </p>
    )
  },
  {
    key: '2',
    label: 'What factors influence BMR?',
    children: (
      <p>
        Factors include age, gender, weight, height, body composition, and genetics. BMR tends to
        decrease with age and is generally higher in men than in women.
      </p>

    key: '3',
    label: 'Is BMR the same as metabolism?',
    children: (
      <p>
        BMR is a component of metabolism but specifically refers to the number of calories burned at
        rest. Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) includes BMR along with calories burned through
        physical activity.
      </p>
    )
  },
  {
    key: '4',
    label: 'How can I use my BMR to manage my weight?',
    children: (
      <p>
        BMR plays a crucial role in weight management. If your daily calorie intake exceeds your
        BMR, you&apos;ll likely gain weight, and if it&apos;s below your BMR, you may lose weight.
        To lose one pound of body weight, you generally need a caloric deficit of approximately
        3,500 calories. Understanding your BMR helps you establish a sustainable and healthy caloric
        deficit or surplus based on your weight goals. It&apos;s important to approach weight
        management holistically, considering both diet and exercise for optimal results.

  {
    key: '5',
    label: 'Can exercise impact my BMR?',
    children: (
      <p>
        Yes, regular physical activity can increase your BMR by building muscle mass. Muscle tissue
        burns more calories at rest than fat tissue, so incorporating strength training can have a
        positive impact on your BMR.
      </p>
    )
  },
  {
    key: '6',
    label: 'How often should I recalculate my BMR?',
    children: (
      <p>
        It&apos;s a good idea to recalculate your BMR when there are significant changes in your
        weight, age, or activity level. This ensures that your calorie intake aligns with your
        current metabolic needs.
      </p>
    )

  {
    key: '7',
    label: 'Are there any health conditions that affect BMR?',
    children: (
      <p>
        Certain medical conditions, such as thyroid disorders, can affect BMR. If you suspect an
        underlying health issue, it&apos;s advisable to consult with a healthcare professional.
